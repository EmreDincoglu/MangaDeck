1. Open steam in desktop mode on the steam deck and go to steam -> settings -> controller
Desktop configuration. wait for a minute or two the first time you open this tab up it takes awhile

To set up your controller settings, go to the steam input controller desktop settings, and use the layout
gotten at this link steam://controllerconfig/413080/3405232829

now that this is all set up, we can start setting up the shortcuts

2. go to system settings -> shortcuts -> custom shortcuts and press edit -> import
You can then choose to import a file, import the file downloaded called MangaDeck shortcuts
now for each of the 5 shortcuts made under the folder MangaDeck which are titled
{Rotate normal, Rotate right, Rotate reverse, Rotate left, Cubari} you will need to 
click on them and go to trigger, there you must click on the box that says none.
once clicked on your steam deck, hold the small button with the three lines on it and then flick the left stick in a direction
for rotate normal flick the left stick down
for rotate right flick the left stick right
for rotate reverse flick the left stick up 
for rotate left flick the left stick left

and for Cubari press down on the left stick to make it click 
(not the direction down like actually pushing it against the steam deck)
(it seems you should only need to do it for normal right and reverse)

make sure after each trigger you accept that it replaces another shortcut 
and then press apply in the bottom right corner

with that done make sure the mangadeck shortcut folder has the check 
box checked meaning it is activated.

now if you hold down the three line button and flick the left stick 
right you will see that the screen rotates to where you flicked. And if you 
hold the three line button and press down on the left joystick it will 
automatically open your default webrowser to cubari.moe

clicking the right stick will make google chrome fullscreen which is what
I recommend using for mangadeck since it allows for the chrome extension
and its what I modeled this entire thing after.

New functionality: the left bumper is now used as a way to open 
and close the side tab while reading a manga, this allows the screen to only be a manga
panel without having any other useless details that may
block or distract you from reading

Stretch mode: if you click down on the left stick in the same 
way you would open up cubari.moe without holding the 3 line button, then cubari.moe will 
turn into a stretched panel mode, in which all panels will
cover the entire screen, this is obviously optional since it 
slightly distorts the image but it also covers the entire screen.


that should be it if u have any questions u can just msg me duh u know me.
