1. Open steam in desktop mode on the steam deck and go to steam -> settings -> controller
Desktop configuration. wait for a minute or two the first time you open this tab up it takes awhile

next look at the image titled mangadeck layout and make your layout look identical (F3 is now F6)

for the small square above the deck labeled directional pad, make it a directional swipe
and make the top part of the dpad the mouse wheel down and make the bottom part of the dpad mouse wheel up

now that this is all set up, we can start setting up the shortcuts

2. go to system settings -> shortcuts -> custom shortcuts and press edit -> import
You can then choose to import a file, import the file downloaded called MangaDeck shortcuts
now for each of the 5 shortcuts made under the folder MangaDeck which are titled
{Rotate normal, Rotate right, Rotate reverse, Rotate left, Cubari} you will need to 
click on them and go to trigger, there you must click on the box that says none.
once clicked on your steam deck, hold the small button with the three lines on it and then flick the left stick in a direction
for rotate normal flick the left stick down
for rotate right flick the left stick right
for rotate reverse flick the left stick up 
for rotate left flick the left stick left

and for Cubari press down on the left stick to make it click (not the direction down like actually pushing it against the steam deck press)

make sure after each trigger you accept that it replaces another shortcut and then press apply in the bottom right corner

with that done make sure the mangadeck shortcut folder has the check box checked meaning it is activated.

now if you hold down the three line button and flick the left stick right you will see that the screen rotates to where the bottom of the
screen is where you flicked. And if you hold the three line button and press down on the left joystick it will automatically open your default webrowser to cubari.moe

Optional: screen shot functionality
under shortcuts click on spectacle and then click on Capture entire desktop, then click on the custom shortcut box like before and hold the same three line button while hitting the left bumper
this is how you can take a screen shot. Everytime you take a screen shot there is a popup but there is a way to stop that but Imma be honest I forgot how and idk how to bring the popup back to re create the solution
so just ask me to help u 

that should be it if u have any questions u can just msg me duh u know me.
